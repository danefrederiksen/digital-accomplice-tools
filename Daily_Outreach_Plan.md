# DA Daily Outreach Plan — All 10 Tools

**Created:** March 1, 2026
**Status:** Active plan, pending all tools going live

---

## LinkedIn DMs (Tools 1–6) — 30 DMs/day cap

| Tool | New/day | Steady-state DMs/day | Notes |
|------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| PT#1 B2B 1st Conn | 3–4 | ~10 | Currently running |
| PT#2 Cyber 1st Conn | 3–4 | ~10 | Currently running |
| PT#3 B2B 2nd Conn | 3–4 | +10–15 connection requests | Separate limit from DMs |
| PT#4 Cyber 2nd Conn | 3–4 | +10–15 connection requests | Same |
| PT#5 Referral Partner 1st | 1–2 | ~5 | Smaller pool, higher value |
| PT#6 Referral Partner 2nd | 1–2 | +5–10 connection requests | Same |

**LinkedIn daily totals:** ~25–30 DMs + 25–40 connection requests

---

## Email (Tools 7–10) — No hard platform cap, but deliverability matters

| Tool | Sends/day | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| PT#7 B2B Leads | 5–10 | Cold, personalized |
| PT#8 Cyber Leads | 5–10 | Cold, personalized |
| PT#9 Substack Subscribers | 3–5 | Warm — they opted in |
| PT#10 Customers | 2–3 | Warmest — reactivation/upsell |

**Email daily totals:** ~15–28 emails

---

## Combined Daily Output

- **~45–60 touches/day**
- **~225–300 touches/week** (5 days)
- That's 3–4x the previous ~65/week
- Big jump comes from email tools 7–10 layering on top of LinkedIn

---

## Daily Sequence (Time Blocking)

1. **Morning:** Run 1st conn DM tools (#1, #2, #5) first
2. **Midday:** Queue 2nd conn requests (#3, #4, #6)
3. **Afternoon:** Send emails (#7, #8, #9, #10)
4. **Keep each session under 15 min per tool**

## Platform Limits Reference

| Platform | Limit | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| LinkedIn DMs (1st conn) | ~50–100/day safe | Won't hit this manually |
| LinkedIn Connection Requests | ~100–200/week (~20–25/day) | The real constraint for 2nd conn tools |
| Gmail (personal) | 500/day | Not a factor |
| Gmail (Workspace) | 2,000/day | Not a factor |
| Email deliverability | Reputation-based | Keep cold email volume reasonable, warm up gradually |
