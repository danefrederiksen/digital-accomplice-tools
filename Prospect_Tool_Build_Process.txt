DA Prospect Tool — Build Process & Design Doc
================================================
Use this as a blueprint for building each tool.
Each step has a CUSTOMIZE section — that's what changes per tool.

Tool 1 (B2B 1st Connections) is the reference build.
Copy this process, swap the CUSTOMIZE values, and you get Tools 2-10.


========================================
STEP 1: Define the Tool's Purpose
========================================
What to do:
- Name the tool
- Define who it tracks (what type of prospect)
- Define the connection status (1st vs 2nd, email vs LinkedIn)
- Define the goal (DMs, emails, referrals, etc.)

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Tool name (e.g., "Cyber 1st Connections DM Tracker")
- Prospect type (B2B, Cyber, Referral Partner, Substack, Customer)
- Connection type (1st connection, 2nd connection, email-only)
- Primary outreach channel (LinkedIn DM, email, connection request)

Tool 1 values:
- Name: B2B 1st Connections DM and Follow-Up Tracker
- Prospect type: B2B (video/creative services buyers)
- Connection type: Already connected on LinkedIn (1st degree)
- Channel: LinkedIn DM


========================================
STEP 2: Define the Sequence Steps
========================================
What to do:
- Map out the outreach sequence from first touch to end state
- Define each status and what triggers the next step
- Set the timing between steps (days between follow-ups)

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Number of steps in the sequence
- Status names and labels
- Days between each step
- End states (replied, cold, converted, etc.)

Tool 1 values:
- Step 1: DM Sent (initial outreach)
- Step 2: Follow-Up 1 (3 days after DM)
- Step 3: Follow-Up 2 / Final Nudge (7 days after DM)
- End states: Replied (success) or Cold (no response)
- Statuses: not_started → dm_sent → follow_up_1 → follow_up_2 → replied OR cold


========================================
STEP 3: Define the Data Model
========================================
What to do:
- List every field stored per prospect
- Define which fields are required vs optional
- Define valid values for status fields

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Fields specific to the outreach type
- Status values matching the sequence
- Any extra fields (e.g., email address for email tools, mutual connections for 2nd degree)

Tool 1 fields:
- id (UUID, auto-generated)
- name (required)
- company
- title
- linkedinUrl
- status (not_started, dm_sent, follow_up_1, follow_up_2, replied, cold)
- dmSentDate
- followUp1Due
- followUp2Due
- lastActionDate
- reply (free text — what they said)
- nextStep (free text — what to do next)


========================================
STEP 4: Define the Import Method
========================================
What to do:
- Decide how prospects get into the tool
- Build CSV parser for the expected format(s)
- Add manual entry as a fallback

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- CSV format (LinkedIn export, custom CSV, email list, etc.)
- Column mapping (which CSV columns map to which fields)
- Title keyword filters (which job titles to prioritize)
- Whether deduplication checks name+company, email, or LinkedIn URL

Tool 1 values:
- Format 1: LinkedIn CSV export (First Name, Last Name, Company, Position, URL)
- Format 2: Headerless CSV (Name, Company, Title, LinkedIn URL)
- Title filter keywords: founder, ceo, cmo, vp marketing, head of marketing,
  creative director, chief marketing, marketing director, co-founder, owner,
  president, managing director
- Dedup key: name + company (lowercase match)


========================================
STEP 5: Build the Server (b2b-serve.js pattern)
========================================
What to do:
- Create a Node.js Express server
- Set a unique port number
- Define data file paths
- Build CRUD API endpoints
- Add security (origin check, sanitization, field whitelist)
- Add auto-backup on every save
- Add activity logging

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Port number (each tool gets a unique port)
- Data file name
- Allowed fields list
- Valid statuses list
- Activity action labels

Tool 1 values:
- Port: 3851
- HTML file: b2b-outreach.html
- Data file: data/b2b-prospects.json
- Activity file: data/b2b-activity.json
- Backup dir: data/backups/
- Max backups kept: 5

API endpoints (same pattern for all tools):
- GET  /                     → Serve the HTML file
- GET  /api/prospects        → Return all prospects
- POST /api/prospects        → Add one or many (with dedup)
- POST /api/prospects/migrate → One-time migration from localStorage
- PUT  /api/prospects/:id    → Update a single prospect
- DELETE /api/prospects/:id  → Remove a prospect
- GET  /api/activity         → Return activity log

Security (same for all tools):
- Origin check (localhost only)
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- Field whitelist (reject unknown fields)
- Status validation (reject invalid statuses)


========================================
STEP 6: Build the Frontend (single HTML file)
========================================
What to do:
- Create a single-file HTML app (HTML + CSS + JS in one file)
- Use DA brand styling
- Build the tab navigation
- Build the card-based UI for prospects

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Page title and header text
- Tab names
- Card layout (which fields to show)
- Action buttons on each card (match the sequence steps)
- Status badge colors

Tool 1 values:
- Title: "DA B2B Outreach Sequencer"
- Tabs: Dashboard, All Prospects, Import
- Card shows: Name, Company, Title, LinkedIn link, Status badge, Timeline
- Action buttons: Mark DM Sent, Mark Follow-Up, Mark Final Nudge, Got Reply, Mark Cold, Reset, Remove
- Colors: Orange #F8901E, black header, Poppins font

DA Brand Standards (same for all tools):
- Primary orange: #F8901E
- Black header bar
- Font: Poppins (Google Fonts)
- White cards with rounded corners (10px)
- Status badges: colored pills
- Mobile responsive (stacks on narrow screens)


========================================
STEP 7: Build the Dashboard Tab (Today View)
========================================
What to do:
- Show an alert banner with key stats
- Group prospects by urgency: Overdue → Due Today → Upcoming → Recent Replies
- Make it the default landing tab

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Stats shown in the banner
- How "overdue" and "due" are calculated
- Section groupings

Tool 1 values:
- Banner stats: Total prospects, Active sequences, Due today, Overdue
- Overdue: follow-up due date < today
- Due Today: follow-up due date = today
- Sections: Overdue, Due Today, Coming Up, Recently Replied


========================================
STEP 8: Build the Import Tab
========================================
What to do:
- Drag-and-drop CSV upload zone
- Parse CSV and show preview table
- Select All checkbox + individual checkboxes
- "Activate Selected" button to add to tool
- Show import results (added vs skipped)

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- CSV parsing logic (column mapping)
- Preview table columns
- Title keyword filter list

Tool 1 values:
- Upload zone accepts .csv files
- Uses PapaParse library for CSV parsing
- Preview table: checkbox, name, company, title, LinkedIn URL
- Select All toggles all checkboxes
- Skips duplicates already in the system


========================================
STEP 9: Build Prospect Cards + Actions
========================================
What to do:
- Design the card layout for each prospect
- Add action buttons that advance the sequence
- Add reply field (appears after marking replied)
- Add next step field
- Add sequence timeline visualization
- Wire up all buttons to server API

CUSTOMIZE for each tool:
- Which action buttons appear
- Button labels
- Timeline step labels
- Whether there's a reply field, email field, notes field, etc.

Tool 1 values:
- Sequence timeline: Not Started → DM Sent → Follow-Up → Final Nudge → (Replied or Cold)
- Reply field: textarea, debounced auto-save (500ms)
- Next step field: text input, debounced auto-save
- Remove: confirmation dialog before delete
- Reset: puts prospect back to Not Started


========================================
STEP 10: Test Everything
========================================
What to do:
- Start the server
- Test CSV import (both formats if applicable)
- Test manual add
- Test each sequence step (click through the full flow)
- Test reply tracking
- Test cold marking
- Test reset and remove
- Test overdue/due today logic
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Verify data persists after server restart

Test checklist (same for all tools):
[ ] Server starts without errors
[ ] HTML loads at localhost:{port}
[ ] CSV import works (correct format)
[ ] Manual add works
[ ] Deduplication works (no double imports)
[ ] Each sequence step advances correctly

[ ] Remove works (with confirmation)
[ ] Data survives server restart
[ ] Backups are created in data/backups/
[ ] Activity log records actions
[ ] Mobile layout doesn't break


========================================

========================================
FILE NAMING CONVENTION
========================================
